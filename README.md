# Intergalactic Receiver

The Intergalactic Receiver is an open-source software and hardware project to showcase the work of shader artists. It looks like an old-school radio tuner, but it's connected to a flickering CRT screen.

Mostly the screen shows static, but as you explore the quantum frequency band you encounter "stations" that are abstract procedural animations. They look like something created by alien minds: mathematical, geometric, but somehow also warm and compassionate. They are multi-dimensional streams of friendship and curiosity from outer space.

The IGR was created by me, Gábor, but it's only the vehicle for the amazing work of the contributing artists: speginel, matthi, ...

It's best to lay back and enjoy the transmissions. But the IGR is also a fun project and I'm sharing all the designs and source code so you can use it in your own projects. There's a page about the [hardware](docs/hardware.md) and another one about the [software](docs/software.md).

If you are an alien artist youself, check out the page on [how to contribute art](docs/contributing-art.md).
